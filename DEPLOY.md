# Deployment Guide for AI Roast Machine

This guide outlines the steps taken to prepare the AI Roast Machine for deployment to GitHub or any other public repository.

## Cleanup Steps Completed

1. **Removed sensitive information**:
   - Verified that the `.env` file is in `.gitignore` and won't be committed
   - Created `.env.example` as a template for users
   - Checked for hardcoded API keys or credentials in the code

2. **Cleaned temporary files**:
   - Removed compiled Python files (`.pyc`, `__pycache__`)
   - Removed system files (`.DS_Store`)
   - Checked for large files that shouldn't be in version control

3. **Created cleanup tools**:
   - Added `cleanup.sh` script for easy cleanup
   - Updated README with cleanup instructions
   - Added security considerations section to README

4. **Verified functionality**:
   - Ran all tests to ensure everything works properly
   - Checked that the application runs correctly
   - Verified that the OpenRouter API connector works with environment variables

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to GitHub, make sure to:

- [ ] Run the cleanup script: `./cleanup.sh`
- [ ] Run all tests: `python run_tests.py`
- [ ] Update version numbers if applicable
- [ ] Update documentation if needed
- [ ] Commit all changes: `git add . && git commit -m "Prepare for deployment"`
- [ ] Push to GitHub: `git push origin main`

## Post-Deployment

After deploying to GitHub:

- [ ] Verify that sensitive information is not exposed
- [ ] Check that the README is displayed correctly
- [ ] Ensure that the installation instructions work
- [ ] Test the application on a fresh clone

## Notes

- The `.env` file contains your OpenRouter API key and should never be committed to version control
- Test results and generated content are stored in directories that are excluded from version control
- The application is designed to work with environment variables for sensitive information
